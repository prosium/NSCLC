**Title:**

Estrogen Signaling as a Putative Target for Never-Smoker Lung Adenocarcinoma Patients without EGFR Mutation and ALK Fusion from Proteogenomic Characterization.

**Significance:** 

The proteogenomic landscape in NSLA without well-known driver mutations reveals prognostic proteins influenced by CNV changes. The distinct pattern of STK11 enhanced estrogen signaling, which has led to the emergence of saracatinib as a potential therapeutic target for NENA NSLA.
